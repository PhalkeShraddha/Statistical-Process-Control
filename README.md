# Statistical-Process-Control
In this project, we were provided with a set of data which was collected from a biomedical instrument in a healthcare process. In this dataset, both in-control and Out-of-Control points are present. Our objective is to establish a method that will quickly detect the occurrence of assignable causes of process shifts so that these assignable causes can be investigated, and corrective actions can be taken before many nonconforming units are manufactured. When we have a set of past data related to the characteristic variables of interest, we can use this data to build a Control Chart for monitoring future data. This is amounted to the Phase I Analysis.
